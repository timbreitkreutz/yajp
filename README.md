Yet another javascript preprocessor

Javascript preprocessors like coffeescript and the ilk do great things to protect us from the bad and ugly parts
of Javascript, but they also force us to learn another language and syntax.

The goal of this project is to provide all the good things a preprocessor gives us, but in a minimalistic way that
respects the Javascript language.  This means fixing things like scoping rules, global leakage, ambiguity around
comparison operators and semicolon insertion, etc., but leaving the prototypical design and basic syntax alone.

If there is already a project like this that I missed please drop me a line at tim@sbrew.com.  I want to know. 
Otherwise, here it goes!
